Fast Ferry Business Case 
==============================

Problem statement:

  • As part of the site roster change, there has been a significant uptick in losses related to parking up the fleet for shift change
  • The main ferry is planned for repairs and a replacement fast ferry has been hired to fill the gap
  • The fast ferry changes the travel time from 30mins to 15mins across the river, saving 15mins in each direction
  • Currently the commuters travel start & end times have been pushed forward 15mins, resulting in no additional upside to the fast ferry
  
Opportunity:
  • Maintain the fast ferry long term and return the employees start/end time to that of the slow ferry to enable an additional 30mins of productive work time for shift swap days
